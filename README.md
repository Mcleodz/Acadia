# Acadia
Acadia is my attempt at creating a small hub for each of the NCEA subjects I will be taking in 2024.

Not only this, it is also an attempt to teach myself the basics of HTML, JS, and CSS.


Acadia is a web based app that allows you to view study guides, past papers, and assessment schedules of the last three yearsof each external NCEA standard taken by students study the following 5 subjects:

L3 Calculus, 

L3 Physics, 

L3 Electronics, 

L3 Software Development, 

and L3 English.
